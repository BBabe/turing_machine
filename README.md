# Turing machine

These scripts are coded for python 3.
The script to execute is "turing.py", the other two being used by it.

In "turing.py":
- Choose a problem, by giving the numbers of the criterion cards used in "crits";
- This script gives all the valid verificators combinations corresponding to these cards, with the associated solution code.
